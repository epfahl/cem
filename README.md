_Note: This library is still under development._

`CEM` is an Elixir framework for applying the cross-entropy method to 
continuous and discrete optimization problems.

This library caters specifically to problems where the probability distribution
for generating candidate solution instances belongs to the 
[exponential family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family).
